// Add "kerning?"/ default spacing depending on the letter. Each letter will have it's own spacing and some math to check the next letters spacing and they can agree on a space between eachother.
// Of course there will be actual spaces as well

// FIX AUTO SPACING + OVERFLOW + SKIPPING + CUSTOM WIDTH CHARACTERS
// ANOTHER method for spacing between characters is just to have a 1px gap on either side. Or 1px on one(the right) side but then there would be an overflow for the last char

// App handler page?
